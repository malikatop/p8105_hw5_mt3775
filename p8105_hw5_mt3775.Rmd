## Problem 1
```{r}
bday_sim = function(n) {
  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n
  return(duplicate)
}

sim_res =
  expand_grid(
    n = c(2:50),
    iter = 1:1000
  ) |> 
  mutate(res = map_lgl(n, bday_sim)) |> 
  group_by(n) |> 
  summarize(prob = mean(res))

sim_res |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) + 
  geom_col()
```

The probability of having at least one other person share a birthday increases as the 
number of people in the group, n, increases. The probability passes 0.5, when n = 23. 
Even with n = 50 though, we don't get a probability of 1 exactly, but we get very close.
If we increase n to 100, then we would definitely have reached 1 by that point.
